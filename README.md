Genetic Algorithm Python Code Sample

Problem to be solved: Linear Equation/Equality Problem

This follows as:
1. Determine the number of chromosomes, generations, crossover and mutation rate.
2. Generate the chromosome to chromosome number in population. and the initialization values of the genes in the chromosome-chromosome with a random value to it.
3. Calculating and evaluating the fitness of the chromosome via objective function.
4. Selecting of the fittest chromosomes to undergo the crossover process.
5. After the crossover process the offsprings from the crossover will undergo the mutation process.
6. Repeat steps from 3 -5 until number of generations defined met.
7. Voila! We get the best chromosome(solution)

Sample Equation to be solved --> a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 30
